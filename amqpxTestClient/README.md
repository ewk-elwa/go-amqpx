# AMQPx Test Client
This project uses:
- amqpx : a lite AMQP library

## Goals
Hope to achieve multiple goals in this project:
1. Exercise the amqpx from the client side
1. Use amqpxClient to test amqpxServer, or to send message for test
1. Measure performance such as:
  * latency
  * throughput
  * connection count & resources used

Let's get started ;)
