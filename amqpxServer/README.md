# AMQPx Server
This project uses:
- getty : a netty styled async TCP event driver TCP server
- amqpx : a lite AMQP library

## Goals
Hope to achieve multiple goals in this project:
1. Exercise the amqpx
1. Use netty-styled server
1. Measure performance such as:
  * latency
  * throughput
  * connection count & resources used

Let's get started ;)
